2목setup bazel
	1밀JDK 8
			sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
	2밀APT
			echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://storage.googleapis.com/bazel-apt stable jdk1.8" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bazel.list`

	3밀bazel
			sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install bazel
			sudo apt-get upgrade bazel
			if not succeed please use method as follows:
			 Download pkg밐bazel-0.7.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh
			 chmod +x bazel-0.7.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh
			 ./bazel-0.7.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh run it and also include SDK
3목Download Tensorflow sourcecode
			git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git
			--recurse-submodules  added for protobuf error
4목config local environment
		please focus on dir:tensorflow\tensorflow\examples\android
		1)modify file:WORKSPACE
		# Uncomment and update the paths in these entries to build the Android demo.
  #android_sdk_repository(
  #    name = "androidsdk",
  #    api_level = 23,
  #    # Ensure that you have the build_tools_version below installed in the 
  #    # SDK manager as it updates periodically.
  #    build_tools_version = "25.0.2",
  #    # Replace with path to Android SDK on your system
  #    path = "<PATH_TO_SDK>",
  #)
  #
  # Android NDK r12b is recommended (higher may cause issues with Bazel)
  #android_ndk_repository(
  #    name="androidndk",
  #    path="<PATH_TO_NDK>",
  #    # This needs to be 14 or higher to compile TensorFlow. 
  #    # Note that the NDK version is not the API level.
  #    api_level=14)
  
  as follows밐
  
android_sdk_repository(
    name = "androidsdk",
    # set sdk as highest level밃and manifest.xml gradle's target
    api_level = 26,
    # Ensure that you have the build_tools_version below installed in the 
    # SDK manager as it updates periodically.
    build_tools_version = "26.0.3",
    # Replace with path to Android SDK on your system
    path = "/home/jim/android-sdk-linux",
)

# recommend version:r12  higher version may caused bazel error.
android_ndk_repository(
    name="androidndk",
    path="/home/jim/android-sdk-linux/ndk-bundle",
    # This needs to be 14 or higher to compile TensorFlow. 
    # Note that the NDK version is not the API level.
    api_level=14)
			
	Attention밐 
		1. api_level set to the highest version밃recommend 23밃modify android:build.gradle 's AndroidManifest.xml and also modify targetSdkVersion 
		2. ndk is recommend r12밃or else compile bazel may cause error몪		
			
5목compile tensorflow_demo	
		into dir:tensorflow and enter the command:밐
			bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/examples/android:tensorflow_demo
	 problem is raised밐use PYTHON3 may cause error in print USAGE밃then set to PYTHON2 is OK몪
	 Reason밐bazel may not support python3.
			
6목install apk
		open the debugger mode밐
			adb install -r bazel-bin/tensorflow/examples/android/tensorflow_demo.apk		

7목Modify TF Detect to makeup your own detect model몪
   first밐May train out your own model and pbtxt믿first line must be 찎찎찎삽econd line is your model detect type밀몪
   second밐Modify ObjectDetection package밃replace two files above and build:
   					bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/examples/android:tensorflow_demo
   Third밐Compile to generate your apk몪
